            <p>Fapr will collect certain bits of information that all users provide. When signing up for Tier 2 & 3
              memberships, Fapr will ask the user to provide front of government issued identification with picture
              (driver's license, passport, or ID card). We only collect this information as a one time event (unless
              another profile is created). We will not ask for an updated ID in future. We collect this information only
              for storage unless illegal activities are detected and/or reported.
            <p> We also collect this information to provide a safe environment for all parties. This is an adult only
              site and Fapr will do its very best to protect children. We do not want children to misuse this site nor
              do we want adults to mistakenly talk to children and end up in trouble with authorities. The collecting of
              this information is also needed to minimize, and possibly eliminate, spammers, fake profiles and
              robots.When a user fills out their profile, the information provided will be stored for display only with
              the users agreement
              of the <a href="./tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.
            <p>
              Fapr will also collect and store credit/debit card information for billing purposes only. There will never
              be any charges unless initiated and authorized by user.
            <p>
              Fapr will NEVER sell or provide user information to a third party (unless illegal activity). Fapr reserves
              the right to use user's preferences, posts, and content to display additional content (ads and
              suggestions) through algorithms. For any questions, please feel free to reach out <a
