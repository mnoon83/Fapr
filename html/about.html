              Fapr is a place to share adult content with others. Not all content will have nudity but dont be shy when
              it shows up. It is meant to be a free and peaceful place to express desires. Whether those desires are
              hidden or full out in the open, Fapr is the place to share it all. No matter what you like, we are here to
              help you show it off. This is meant for sexully explicit content but also anything is welcome, even cat
              memes. Please feel free to share anything you want.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fapr is the idea that something had been taken away from people when a certain other app took away
              something vital for many people. We wanted to bring that part of the internet back into the hands of the
              people. Fapr is meant for adult content of any sort that is out there. Gay, straight, trans, furry,
              leather, BDSM, or whatever else you are into. There is nothing taboo about being on Fapr and liking what
              you like. Please feel free to share whatever you want. Even if it's totally vanilla, we are happy that you
              decided to join our family and share it out loud.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from the posts that are shared, Fapr wants to bring communities together. We know that the other
              site took away a lot of connections and we want to help bring those connections back. There were plenty of
              colorful personalities out there and we want to help everyone feel welcome. This is an open platform to be
              who you want to be. There is no room on Fapr for hate or shaming. If you dont like something, keep
              scrolling or use the elipses (...) to indicate you're not interested.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we move forward, there will be bigger and better changes. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts that
              you have decided to become part of our Fapr community.
