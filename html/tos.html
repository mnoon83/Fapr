        <p>
          Please read the Terms of Service completely for proper understanding. By reading the Terms of Service you
          agree to
          follow the rules set forth by Fapr and its parent company NoonCorp. Any violation of these rules may lead to
          disciplinary action (see below).
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="mod"><u>Modifications</u></h3>
        <p>
          Fapr can and will have modifications on a regular basis as we grow, learn, and expand. These modifications
          will reflect
          suggestions from users as well as design changes from a growing app.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="use"><u>Use and eligibility</u></h3>
        <p>
          To use Fapr, you must be over the age of eighteen (18). Fapr is intended for adult use and entertainment only.
          If using
          while under eighteen (18), profile will be deleted immediately. For safety concerns, we ask that you do not
          post private
          or personal information of yourself or others. We understand that there are certain groups of people that are
          into
          submissive and dominating scenarios. Posting and sharing private and personal information is NOT protected by
          Fapr but
          will be taken down should the person it is about ask for is to be removed. If this happens the user posting
          will be
          notified to restrict posts. Additional violations will have higher consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the following while accessing or using the
          services:
          (a) tamper with, or use non-public areas of the services, or the computer or delivery systems of Fapr and/or
          its service
          providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise
          attempt to
          breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or attempt to access or
          search the
          services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published
          interfaces that are
          provided by Fapr (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions) or unless permitted by Fapr’s robots.txt
          file or
          other robot exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the services, and particularly scrape content from the services;
          (e) use
          the services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation
          by
          forging TCP-IP packet headers or email headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the
          access of
          any other user of the Services, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to,
          spamming, or
          overloading the services, or by scripted use of the services in such a manner as to interfere with or create
          an undue
          burden on the services.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="reg"><u>Registration</u></h3>
        <p>
          All users must register to use the services of Fapr. You will need to create an account and provide age,
          email, and
          password. You will also be asked to create a unique Fapr name that will not be able to be duplicated by
          another user. If
          user purchases a tier (see below), use will need to provide identification and credit/debit card information.
          All
          information will be kept confidential, with safety measures put in place, unless authorities need to be
          contacted about
          illegal activities (see above). Though we will keep your information confidential, it is your responsibility
          to keep
          your password secure. If there is a suspected loss or theft of your password, notify Fapr support immediately
          and proper
          secure actions will be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those cautious about providing information, this is to help with the safety of minors. Yes, anyone can lie
          and make
          a profile with a fake age. Gathering additional information for tiers two (2) and three (3) is to protect
          minors from
          talking to people they shouldn’t be. Please see the tier benefits below for clarification.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="pri"><u>Privacy</u></h3>
        <p>
          For information about how Fapr collects, uses, and shares your information, please review our Privacy Policy.
          By using
          the services, you agree you have read the Privacy Policy, which describes our collection, use, and sharing (as
          set forth
          in the Privacy Policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to the United States
          and/or other
          countries for storage, processing, and use by Fapr and the Fapr affiliates.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="cont"><u>Content</u></h3>
        <p>
          There are and will be many different types of interests and users that will post. Please feel free to post
          material
          (pictures, videos, GIFs, words) you would like to. Any and all posts are welcome aside from one, which is
          child
          pornography. Any post pertaining to nude underage children or underage children in sexual acts will be
          immediately
          removed and the user suspended up to three times then banned for life. First suspension will be 3 days. Second
          suspension will be 10 day. Third suspension will be 30 days. If there is another illegal post after the third
          suspension, the user will be banned and reported to authorities. If you feel a post removal or suspension was
          unwarranted, please contact support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though not illegal, Fapr will not permit any political ads, misinformation or religious promotions. Making
          jokes about a
          political figure is permissible regardless of which side of the aisle. Direct pro-political posts (ie ‘This
          person for
          president 2024’) will not be allowed. Any misinformation on any subject will be removed. Yes, there will be
          fact
          checkers when/if a post of misinformation is reported. Religious jokes are fine but nothing promoting any
          particular
          religion. Fapr is meant to have fun with sexual proclivities and we would like it to stay that way. If you
          want to
          promote certain things, please use another social media platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is content that is yours and you would like it removed, please first contact the user who posted it.
          If they
          will not remove or don’t respond, please contact support.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="tre"><u>Treatment</u></h3>
        <p>
          Here at Fapr, we do not and will not tolerate bullying and/or harrassment. This is a place of free thinking and personal expression. Jokes and playful banter are allowed but outright hateful comments are restricted. Moderators will not be monitoring comments but if the user who is harrassed reports it, it will be looked into and the comment removed. Should the comment be valid harrassment, the person making the comment will be notified a comment (not which specific comment) has been removed. Continual harrassment could lead to suspension or banning of the user and their profile.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold" id="poi"> <u>Points</u></h3>
        <p>
          A point system has been created to make Fapr a bit more enjoyable then just mindlessly scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earning points: You earn 100 points by simply creating a profile. Likes, comments, and shares (basically,
          being
          interactive) will earn you 1 point each (up to 100 points per day). There will be a referral reward of 50
          points. Daily
          log in bonuses. 100 points for every dollar spent on tier membership. Reporting inappropriate content will be
          earn
          points based on a system. Our moderators can only see so much. We will partially rely on the users to keep the
          Fapr
          community safe. The first person to report a validly inappropriate content will earn 100 points. Every person
          after that
          will earn one less point than the person before them (i.e. first: 100, second: 99, third: 98, etc.). Users who
          abuse the
          reporting system will face possible suspension depending on severity. Referral code points cannot be earned
          for any one person's additional profile(s)
        </p>
        <p>
          Using points: Points can be turned in for free months of tier membership, merch in store, or a variety of gift
          cards
        </p>
